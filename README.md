___

### Getting Started
1. First, You need to install It, just like You would do with any NPM package:
```
npm i --save react-floating-action-button
```

2. Then, You need to import the library components within your own component
``` javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Container, Button, Link } from 'react-floating-action-button'
```

3. You can now start using the FAB components!
``` javascript
export default const YourAwesomeComponent = () => {
    return (
        <Container>
          <Link href="/"
            tooltip="Create note link"
            icon="far fa-sticky-note"
          />
          <Link href="/"
            tooltip="Add user link"
            className="fab-item btn btn-link btn-lg text-white"
            icon="fas fa-user-plus"
          />
          <Button
            tooltip="The big plus button!"
            icon="fas fa-plus"
            rotate
            onClick={() => alert('FAB Rocks!')} 
          />
        </Container>
    )
}
```


### About Components
- **Container** - It's simply a nav element that contains fab-container in its class list. You must involve your fab-items inside a Container, so the default styles are applied properly. Note that the last child will be recognized as the bigger button that is always visible and triggers the menu opening on hover.
- **Button** - A special button element that has the class fab-item and an "i" element as its first child. You can add a click function callback by passing a "onClick" property, just like you would do with a regular button.
- **Link** - Works exactly like the Button component, but instead of an "onClick", You need to pass a "href" prop to It.

**NOTE**: All components support props.children rendering, which in combination with custom styles, will give You a lot of customization options.

### Extra Styling
- **Container** - You can add custom classes using the "className" string property. You can also add custom styles by passing an object to the "styles" property, just like you would do with the regular style.
- **Button and Link** - Both Support all mentioned for the Container, plus It gives You the option to add custom icon classes by passing an "icon" string property, as well as custom icon styles by passing an object property "iconStyles"

### Material Colors
React-floating-action-button also exports two objects: lightColors and darkColors. These objects contain a few preset material colors that You can use when passing custom styles to the components, and help You to keep the overall design concise.

**Usage**
``` javascript
...
import { Container, Button, lightColors, darkColors } from 'react-floating-action-button'
...
<Container>
    <Button
     tooltip="The big plus button!"
     styles={{
        backgroundColor: darkColors.lighterRed,
        color: lightColors.white,
      }}
     />
</Container>

```
